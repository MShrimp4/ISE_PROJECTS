  Number of Slice LUTs:                        359 out of   5,720    6%
    Number used as logic:                      359 out of   5,720    6%
      Number using O6 output only:             252
      Number using O5 output only:               2
      Number using O5 and O6:                  105
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of   1,440    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                   128 out of   1,430    8%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                       128 out of   2,860    4%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:          376
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:           267 out of     376   71%
    Number with an unused LUT:                  17 out of     376    4%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:          92 out of     376   24%
    Number of unique control sets:              17
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              82 out of  11,440    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
